Hello there!

This is a simple and potential fun app that randomly generates albums. The app retrieves data from 3 separate APIs: Wikipedia(artist name), unSplash(album image), and Tadas Talaikis' random quote API(album name). 

After retrieving the API data asynchronously, the results are altered and generated on the webpage.
